# AI Projects (CS235 / CS50 AI)
This repository contains projects related to Artificial Intelligence, which were developed as part of the CS 235 course at IIIT Guwahati.

Reference has been taken from Harvard's CS50 AI course and TechWithTim.

## Projects
1. Tic Tac Toe 
2. Checkers

Implementation of Game Theory, Min-Max algorithm, and Alpha-Beta Pruning.

### Tic Tac Toe
The Tic Tac Toe project is an implementation of the game using game theory concepts and algorithms. The computer player uses the Min-Max algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to decide its moves. The project is developed using Python programming language, and the user interface is built using the Pygame library.

### Checkers
Checkers is a two-player board game that is played on an 8x8 checkered board. Each player starts with 12 pieces called checkers, which are placed on the dark squares of the board. The objective of the game is to capture all of the opponent's pieces or block them so that they cannot make a move. The game involves strategic planning, and players need to think ahead to anticipate their opponent's moves. In this project, the game has been implemented using game theory concepts and algorithms like Min-Max with Alpha-Beta pruning to create an intelligent computer player.

## Installation
To run the projects, make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. To check, open the command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac/Linux) and type 'python --version'. 

If Python is not installed on your system, you can download and install it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
